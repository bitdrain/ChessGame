- Pieces/Figures & different moves (OO Design)
- Rules
- Table board -> fix: an image?
- A map for each piece on the board ?
- Algorithm or smart ML technique / AI
- Graphical interface
- 3 operation modes: (1) Person vs Person, (2) Person vs computer and (3) computer vs computer 
- Logging of moves and execution times
- Move of cursor
- Use database for taking genious previous games or ideas
- Key algorithms
	- move generation
	- board evaluation
	- minimax
	- alpha beta pruning (very fast)
	
- Is there any library for move generation?
- Is there a library for visualizing the board?
- "Stockfish"
- Search algorithms
- Graph tree with possible moves (limit tree depth)
- Evaluation function
